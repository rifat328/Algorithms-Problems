### If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:

    ** Bredth First Search **

### If the tree is very deep and solution are rare

    ** BFS (DFS will take so much time and solution is rare ,because the tree is very deep) **

### If the tree is very wide

    **DFS (BFS might take up to much memory **

### IF solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree

    ** DFS **

### Determining whether a path exist between two nodes

    **DFS**

### Finding the shortest Path

    **BFS**
